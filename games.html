    <h1> Games I've Worked On </h1>
    Vivid:
    <p>A 3-D action platformer where the player has the ability to change the
    physics of the plaftorms and objects aroudn them by manipulating the light
    from a glowing lantern. Made during the Game Design class at Tufts in Fall
    of 2016.</p>

    <h1> Current Projects: </h1>
    <a href="https://sonatastar.github.io/potion-clicker/">Potion Clicker</a>:
    <p> An incremental game about gathering resources... and then making
      potions! It's currently in super early development, so who knows if it
      will stick around?</p>

    <h1> Unfinished for Now: </h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/SonataStar/grief-text-game">Tower of Happiness</a>:
    <p> An Inform 7 text-adventure game, mostly written during Polyhack 2016 at
      Tufts in a collaborative effort with Avita Sharma and Stephanie Li.
       We're still planning on finishing this... sometime? </p>
