    <h1> About Me </h1>

    <div class = "content">
      <p> My name is Christopher Hylwa, I'm currently a junior at Tufts
        University, majoring in Computer Science. I live and work in Boston, MA.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary passion in life is to become a world-class game designer and
        developer, whatever that takes. I've worked on multiple small projects,
        including text adventure games, interactive fiction, 2-D puzzle games,
        and just last semester as a team of 5 making a 3-D action platforming game.
